# GO Gate (MANDATORY — applies to ALL code changes)

## STOP before every code change
Before using Edit, Write, or NotebookEdit tools, ask yourself:
**"Did the user say GO?"**

If NO → STOP. Do not write code. Wait for explicit GO.

## What counts as GO
- The word "GO" (case-insensitive)
- "Do it", "Proceed", "Make the change"

## What does NOT count as GO
- "Clear?" / "YES" / "NO" — these are confirmation questions, not permission
- "Fix the validator" — this is a description of what to do, not permission to do it
- "Investigate and report" — this is a research request, not permission to code
- Silence or implied agreement

## No exceptions
Even if the fix is obvious, even if you already know exactly what to change — wait for GO.
