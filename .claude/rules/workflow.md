# Workflow Rules (MANDATORY)

## No Coding Without Approval
- Read CLAUDE.md before every task
- Read SPEC.md before implementing
- Do not code without explicit GO from the user
- Do not make changes beyond what was asked

## Verification Required
Every change must be verified before committing:
- Server starts without errors
- Feature works end-to-end (API test or browser)
- No JavaScript console errors
- No Python server errors

## Communication
- When asked a direct question, answer it directly — do not take action
- Never guess or hallucinate — read the code first
- If you don't know, say so
- Do not over-postulate — the user will clarify
